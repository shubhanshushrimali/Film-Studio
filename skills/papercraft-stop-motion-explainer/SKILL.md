# Papercraft Stop-Motion Explainer

Use for science, education, or knowledge content whose approved visual language is handmade papercraft stop motion.

## Prompt overlay

- Convert abstract concepts into touchable paper objects, puppets, layers, paths, cross-sections, labels, arrows, or mechanisms.
- Make paper construction visible: cut edges, fibers, folds, seams, tabs, brads, joints, sliders, rotating discs, and material thickness.
- Use foreground, midground, background, and when useful far-background planes with real layer separation and shadows.
- Motion should look hand-manipulated frame by frame: small stepped changes, tiny pauses, slight rebounds, hinged gestures, page flips, pull-tabs, sliders, and settling paper.
- Background motion should also obey paper mechanics.
- Prefer miniature-camera behavior, gentle parallax, slow push-ins, lateral pans, macro detail, and stable views for reading.
- Avoid smooth plastic CG transformation, liquid morphing, flat vector scenery, or camera motion that breaks the miniature-stage illusion.
- Preserve the knowledge claim exactly. Style is not permission to simplify a scientific fact into a different claim.

## H3 handoff

Whether this skill was selected automatically or invoked directly, return through `h3-prompt-writing`, then `minimax-h3`, then `scripts/minimax_h3_prompt_validator.py`, and finally `prompt-qc`; this skill is a content/style overlay, not a standalone final-prompt path.
Use this skill to shape visual/action/sound content, then use `h3-prompt-writing` for H3 structure and `minimax-h3` for Story-Film authority.
