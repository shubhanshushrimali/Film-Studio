# Paper Collage Explainer Generator

Use when narration, a knowledge point, opinion, or abstract idea should be visualized as a tactile paper collage rather than a dimensional papercraft diorama.

## Prompt overlay

- Extract one meaning or narration beat per visual beat and express it with a clear paper-collage metaphor.
- Use cut-paper silhouettes, torn edges, halftone print texture, layered scraps, pasted shapes, paper shadows, and visibly tactile composition.
- Animate with paper slides, pops, taps, flattening, tearing, folding, replacement, and small stop-motion shifts.
- Keep the composition legible enough that metaphor supports the idea rather than obscuring it.
- Use tactile paper sounds where appropriate.
- Preserve source narration and factual claims. Do not invent explanation content to fill a visual gap.
- Distinguish this route from `papercraft-stop-motion-explainer`: choose paper-collage when flat layered collage and graphic metaphor dominate; choose papercraft when miniature diorama depth and physical paper mechanisms dominate.

## H3 handoff

Whether this skill was selected automatically or invoked directly, return through `h3-prompt-writing`, then `minimax-h3`, then `scripts/minimax_h3_prompt_validator.py`, and finally `prompt-qc`; this skill is a content/style overlay, not a standalone final-prompt path.
Apply the collage grammar to content, then format through `h3-prompt-writing` and enforce Story-Film constraints with `minimax-h3`.
