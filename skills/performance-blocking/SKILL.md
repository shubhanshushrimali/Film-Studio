# Performance Blocking

## Workflow

1. Read core contract, `CHARACTER_PROFILE.md`, `PERFORMANCE_BLOCKING.md`, screenplay, line manifest, canon, current story state, continuity, director book, previz when present, and production capabilities.
2. Work one scene at a time. Use movement and stillness signatures as defaults, then record the specific playable behavior this scene requires.
3. Write `03_preproduction/performance_blocking.jsonl` using stable `LINE-###`, `SCN-###`, and character IDs.
4. Separate position-changing moves from gestures, posture, expressions, prop interactions, and other actions.
5. Preserve initial and end performer state when position, posture, possession, or orientation changes.
6. Use capability keys when execution is constrained. Split or flag combinations the selected production route cannot reliably perform.
7. Use estimated timing until measured audio or media exists.
8. Reconcile adjacent line states before leaving the scene.

## Done

Every performance unit in scope can be staged from files alone and does not require an unavailable action or invented location anchor.
