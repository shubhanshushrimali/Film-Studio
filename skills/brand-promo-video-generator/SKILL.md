# Brand Promo Video Generator

Use for promotional shorts built from verified or user-provided identity-bearing brand assets.

## Prompt overlay

- Build from a brand truth sheet: exact product name, verified capabilities, approved claims, authentic logo/wordmark, brand colors, typography behavior, UI/product imagery, CTA, and disclaimers.
- Never invent product claims, metrics, UI states, logos, packaging, or brand marks.
- Assign each beat a visual owner, concrete product/brand proof, readable copy, primary action, and transition.
- Prefer product motion, UI flow, cursor motion, geometry, object edges, light, or matched movement as transition drivers.
- Keep one primary action per beat and create deliberate energy peaks with quieter readable holds.
- Preserve logo clear space and copy readability.
- Generated imagery may support atmosphere or conceptual motion, but must not impersonate unverified identity-bearing evidence.

## H3 handoff

Whether this skill was selected automatically or invoked directly, return through `h3-prompt-writing`, then `minimax-h3`, then `scripts/minimax_h3_prompt_validator.py`, and finally `prompt-qc`; this skill is a content/style overlay, not a standalone final-prompt path.
Format the final audiovisual prompt with `h3-prompt-writing`. Story-Film source provenance and canon override promotional embellishment.
