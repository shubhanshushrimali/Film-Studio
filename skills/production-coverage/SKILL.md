# Production Coverage

## Workflow

1. Read core contract and `PRODUCTION_COVERAGE.md`.
2. Run `python scripts/production_coverage.py <project>` for the requested scope.
3. Inspect missing dialogue cues, missing shot coverage, blocking gaps, text drift, unresolved shot references, timing conflicts, and required visible-dialogue sync gaps or speaker/timing conflicts.
4. Fix the smallest upstream artifact that owns the error. Do not invent coverage inside the report.
5. Re-run until `ready` is true for the intended production scope or record the blocker.

## Done

The report proves every required machine-readable screenplay unit in scope has the expected production links, with no exact-dialogue drift or unresolved production references.
