# Long Range Continuity

## Use

1. Read `../../references/LONG_RANGE_CONTINUITY.md`.
2. Read the current durable project state before you make a decision.
3. Work on the smallest valid `SEQ-###`, job frontier, or global gate.
4. Use `../../scripts/long_range_continuity.py` for deterministic state changes or checks.
5. Save the result before you continue.
6. If the result blocks progress, keep the current Todo target blocked until the problem is fixed.

## Rules

- Do not load the full feature-film state when a sequence shard is sufficient.
- Do not infer completion from file existence alone.
- Do not hide an exception. Record the exception and the reason.
- Preserve stable IDs and project-relative paths.
- Use global checks only when the check needs global evidence.

## Done

The requested feature-scale state is written, validated, and traceable from durable project files.
