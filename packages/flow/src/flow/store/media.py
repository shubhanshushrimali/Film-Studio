"""Media library — generated/imported assets and the folders that organize them.

Assets are decoupled from clips: a Clip references a ``source_media_id``, so
reorganizing or renaming library assets never breaks a render, and one asset
can back multiple clips. Deletes are soft (Trash) — see UndoEntry.
