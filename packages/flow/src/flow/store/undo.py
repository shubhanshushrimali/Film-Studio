"""Undo log — server-authoritative LIFO of reversible edits.

Every mutating tool pushes an UndoEntry capturing what's needed to revert
(a ``before`` snapshot of the affected entities). The ``undo`` tool pops and
restores. Generation side-effects (paid output) are never destroyed by undo —
they detach, not delete (the asset stays in the library).
